== Description ==
Widget that grabs a random Octocat from the GitHub octodex and the latest commit from the master branch of a public GitHub repository.  It can be used as a normal widget by going to Apperance > Widgets, by adding the shortcode `[wpgrc username="username"]` in your post editor, or by adding `<?php wpgrc( array( 'username' => 'username' ); ?>`.  You can checkout a live demo of all three [here][demo](http://demo.danholloran.com/github-commit-widget-demo/) and get more information about all three under the installation tab.
